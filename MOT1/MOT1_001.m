function varargout = MOT1_001(varargin)
% MOT1_001 MATLAB code for MOT1_001.fig
%      MOT1_001, by itself, creates a new MOT1_001 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = MOT1_001 returns the handle to a new MOT1_001 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      MOT1_001('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in MOT1_001.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      MOT1_001('Property','Value',...) creates a new MOT1_001 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before MOT1_001_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to MOT1_001_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
